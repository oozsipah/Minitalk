# üõ∞Ô∏è minitalk

**minitalk** is a small LINUX-based messaging project developed as part of the 42 Network curriculum.

This project demonstrates how two separate processes can communicate using POSIX signals ‚Äî specifically SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2 ‚Äî to transmit characters one bit at a time. The purpose is not to build a production-ready application, but to practice and understand key system-level programming concepts such as:

-	**Signal handling** with `signal`
-   **Asynchronous communication**
-   **Process synchronization**
-   **Bit-level data transmission**

Through this project, I learned how to use signals to transmit data between processes, how to implement a basic communication protocol from scratch, and how to deal with the limitations of signal-based messaging.
It helped me get more comfortable with low-level programming in C and understand the basics of inter-process communication.

### üõ†Ô∏è System Functions Used

```c
kill() /* sends a signal to another process */
signal() /* Defines a handler for a spesific signal */ 
write()  /* Writes data to given filedescriptors (like stdout) */
usleep() /* Pauses the program for a given nummbe of microseconds */ 
exit()  /* Terminates the program with a status code */
getpid()  /* Returns the process id (PID) of the current process */
pause() /* suspends the program until a signal is received */
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation

To compile the project, simply run:

```bash
make
```
This will create two executables

	‚Ä¢	server
	‚Ä¢	client

### üß™ Usage

First, run the server:

```bash
./server
```

It will print its PID to the standard output. For example:

```
SERVER PID: 12345
```
Then, in another terminal, run the client with the server‚Äôs PID and your message as arguments:

```bash
./client 12345 "hello from client"
```
